* It's an application that offers search feature to filter houses depending on different fields (#beds, area, #rooms)
* Different tools were applied and used in this project like `jenkins`, `cucumber` for BDD and testing
* `Composite design pattern` was applied on the search feature to be able to construct complex searches according to the user's preferences to the chosen fields
